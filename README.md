# Text-Summarizer
Its an android app, where we make use of an open source API, RESOOMER, upon calling it we get the target result in JSON format and then processed to Summarized format of the given Text.

The developer site link is->https://resoomer.com/developers/en/,You can get the api key here

On making this,we faced difficulties on parsing the output from json to native text.

The main feature is you can download the summarized text as .pdf file and even you can share it with your friends on various messaging platforms like messenger,whatsapp etc.

This project is initated as a mini project at a competition held at our college at Mar 2019.This is like a beta release,bugs are welcomed and happy commiting!
